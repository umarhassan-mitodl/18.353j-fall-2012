Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Prerequisites for this course are 8.02 _Electricity and Magnetism_, and [18.03 _Differential Equations_](/courses/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010). Knowledge of ordinary differential equations is essential. Some linear algebra (knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues) is also necessary. Having some experience with numerical computation is helpful but not necessary. This is an undergraduate course. Graduate students are reminded that this course carries no graduate credit and are encouraged to take [18.385J _Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos_](/courses/18-385j-nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-fall-2004) instead.

Course Description
------------------

This course provides an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and chaos in dissipative systems. The content is structured to be of general interest to undergraduates in engineering and science. The course concentrates on simple models of dynamical systems, and their relevance to natural phenomena. The emphasis is on nonlinear phenomena that may be described by a few variables that evolve with time. The theory of nonlinear continuum systems is covered in the sequel to this course, _Nonlinear Dynamics II: Continuum Systems_ (12.207J/18.354J).

Format
------

To promote the notion of numerical experiments, we assign several laboratory-like problem sets that require the use of a computer. The computer exercises usually use MATLAB®, but students are free to use whatever software tools and computers they desire. No previous experience with numerical computation is necessary.

Requirements and Grading
------------------------

There will be problem sets assigned weekly (or nearly weekly). Some problems will be analytical while others will require use of a computer.

There will be a midterm examination. The midterm exam will have a classroom written portion and a take-home computational portion.

At the end of the semester there will be a major assignment (in lieu of a final exam) due at the time of the last scheduled class. This assignment will require the assimilation of the semester's work.

Problem sets should represent the student's own work but cooperation in the form of, say, comparison of one's numerical results with another's, or helpful hints, is welcome. The final assignment, however, must be an entirely individual effort. Students are not permitted to consult previously corrected problem sets, or solution sets or exams from previous years.

The final grade will be based approximately as follows:

Textbooks
---------

The most important book, which we recommend that you purchase, is:

Strogatz, S. _Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos: With Applications To Physics, Biology, Chemistry, And Engineering_. Westview Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780738204536.  
Strogatz will be especially valuable for our discussion of stability of ordinary differential equations.

The following book may also be useful:  
Berge, P., Y. Pomeau, and C. Vidal. _Order within Chaos_. Wiley-VCH, 1987. ISBN: 9780471849674.
